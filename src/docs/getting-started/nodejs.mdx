 ## Getting Started with Node.js
This tutorial will show you how to deploy your Node.js app in several minutes. These instructions will also give you enough information to make the most out of Exorun.

### Prepare the app
In this step, you will prepare a sample application that’s ready to be deployed to Exorun.

To clone a local version of the sample application that you can then deploy to Exorun, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/exorunltd/node-js-getting-started
$ cd node-js-getting-started
```
You now have a functioning Git repository that contains a simple application as well as a package.json file, which is used by Node’s dependency manager.

### Deploy the app
In this step you will deploy the app to Exorun.

Create an app on Exorun, which prepares exorun to receive your source code.

```sh
$ exorun create [appname]
  Creating b44a48e40... done
  https://appname.exorun.dev | git@git.exorun.io:yourusername/appname.git
  Git remote exorun added
```
When you create an app, a git remote (called exorun) is also created and associated with your local git repository.

Now deploy your code:
```sh
$ git push exorun master
```
