# SSH Keys
To deploy your app using git you need to add SSH public key.
The process of adding SSH keys vary across different OS.

#### OS X or Linux
If you use Exorun cli (recommended), you only need to run exorun login command and system will generate the key if there are no keys.

***If you use ssh-keygen, follow these steps***

Generate the key:
```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f $HOME/.ssh/username@exorun.io.id_rsa
```
You can also add the final key to ssh-agent:
```sh
ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/username@exorun.io.id_rsa
```

Copy your public key:
```sh
$ xsel -b < $HOME/.ssh/username@exorun.io.id_rsa.pub # (Linux)
```
```sh
$ pbcopy < $HOME/.ssh/username@exorun.io.id_rsa.pub # (Mac OS X)
```
#### Windows
Adding SSH keys on Windows you need to follow these steps:
Set up git for Windows, that includes ssh utilities.
In Start Menu choose Git Bash item that opens a console window.

Run this command:
```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f $HOME/.ssh/username@exorun.io.id_rsa
```
Open Explorer and enter this path:
```sh
%USERPROFILE%/.ssh
```
Open file `username@exorun.io.id_rsa.pub` in Notepad, copy everything.
