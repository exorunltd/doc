# Regions

## What Are Regions?

The Exorun Platform gets close to users by running applications in datacenters close to users. These datacenters are identified by region.

The platform works out which region an application should be running in based on the incoming connection from a client. It then starts the application in that region and completes the connection.

This means that an application does not need to know which region it is running in.


## Discovering your Application's Region

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Region ID</th>
      <th>Region Location</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ams</td>
      <td>Amsterdam, Netherlands</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>osl</td>
      <td>Oslo, Norway</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

## Usage
```sh
exorun regions
```
